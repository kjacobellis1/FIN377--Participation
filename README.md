# Welcome to My Participation Folder! :smile:


This repo includes folders of the comprehensive material and lines of code that I learned in class!

### There are 5 folders inside this repo:
1. **navigating_github.md**
  - This is a markdown file started early on in the semester used to store useful info.
  - It contains:
    - Three markdown features
    - A section with useful URLs
    - A section with "How to" Notes
    - Golden Rules
2. **codebook/**
  - This folder contains **My personal python cheatsheet.ipnyb**, which contains whatever reusable code snippets I found useful during class, kinda like a recipe book
3. **homework/**
  - This is a folder for homework and after class practice files; containing Numpy practice, Pandas practice, Visualization practice, etc. 
4. **livecoding/**
  - This is a folder for our livecoding files from Lecture 1 to Lecture 20
5. **.gitignore**
  - This folder is created so the GitHub master repo doesnâ€™t have unnecessary files
  
#### ENJOY! :boom:
